# PSO-ANN-Training

## Overview
This project implements a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The PSO algorithm is used to optimize the weights of the ANN, allowing it to learn from the training data and make predictions on new data.


## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure you have Octave installed on your machine.
2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.

## Usage Guidelines
1. Place your training and testing data in the same directory.
2. Modify the parameters in `Main.m` as needed to suit your dataset and model requirements.
3. Run `Main.m` to start the training process using the PSO algorithm.

## Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
PSO is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively improving candidate solutions with regard to a given measure of quality. In this project, PSO is used to optimize the weights of the ANN, allowing it to learn from the training data effectively.
